# Where to base:
- Listvyanka for quick access from Irkutsk and easy day trips.  
- Olkhon (Khuzhir) for wild scenery and sunset capes.  
- Eastern shore for quieter villages and forest hikes.

# When to visit:  
- Winter (Feb/Mar): Glassy ice, caves, hovercraft tours.  
- Summer (Jun/Aug): Trails, boat trips, and warm evenings.
 
# Book early: Transport to Olkhon, small guesthouses, and popular tours fill up fast.  
# Pack: Layers, sun & wind protection, and cash for small shops outside cities.
