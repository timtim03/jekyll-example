1. **Smoked omul** with black bread and pickles.  
2. **Buuzy**—juicy dumplings; try lamb or veggie versions.  
3. **Sea-buckthorn tea**—bright, vitamin-packed, perfect after windy walks.  
4. **Pine-nut sweets**—from brittle to creamy cakes.  
5. **Taiga herb blends**—sip ivan-tea or thyme while watching the lake.

*Pro tip:* In village cafés, ask what’s **house-made**—you’ll often get the freshest taste.
