## Choose Your Season

### Winter (Feb–March) {#winter}
**Ice Road & Grottos:**  
Clear ice with giant bubbles and deep cracks; visit coastal caves and arches.

**Skating & Hovercraft:**  
Glide along smooth natural rinks or join a hovercraft tour to remote capes.

**Safety:**  
Always go with a certified guide, check thickness, and wear windproof layers.

### Summer (June–August) {#summer}
**Great Baikal Trail:**  
Day hikes above Listvyanka or multi-day treks near the Eastern shore.

**Boat & Kayak:**  
Cruises to Peschanaya Bay, small-group kayaking in calm coves.

**Olkhon Island:**  
Drive the northern capes (Khoboy, Uzury) for jaw-dropping cliffs and sunsets.

### Culture & Relax
**Banya (Steam Bath):**  
Traditional Siberian wellness—ideal after a hike or ice day.

**Craft & Markets:**  
Birch-bark art, felt goods, pine-nut treats. Buy local; avoid wildlife products.

### Practical Tips
- Weather swings fast—pack layers year-round.  
- Cash is handy in small villages; ATMs are limited outside cities.  
- Help keep Baikal clean: refill bottles, carry out all trash.
