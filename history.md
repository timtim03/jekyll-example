## Baikal Through the Ages

**Ancient / Indigenous Traditions**  
For Buryat and Evenk peoples, Baikal is a living spirit. Ritual sites and **serge** (wooden totems) still mark sacred places around the lake.

**Exploration & Rails**  
Cossack expeditions reached Baikal in the 17th century. In the early 1900s, the **Circum-Baikal Railway** carved tunnels into cliffs, linking Siberia to the Pacific.

**Nature & Protection**  
Unique endemics (like the **nerpa** seal) inspired reserves and national parks. Community guides now lead low-impact tours and shoreline cleanups.

# Must-See Heritage
- **Olkhon Island:** Shaman Rock (Burkhan Cape)—a symbol of the lake  
- **Taltsy Museum:** Wooden Siberian architecture on the Angara River  
- **Circum-Baikal:** Historic tunnels, bridges, and photo stops along the shore

**Respect sites—avoid climbing on sacred rocks and follow local guidance.**
